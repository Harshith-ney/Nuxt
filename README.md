# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

You can do all of your development in 'app.vue', or you can get more advanced by:

- Using Vue and Nuxt's page/components system
- Practicing proper environment safety via Nuxt's server API

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

```
